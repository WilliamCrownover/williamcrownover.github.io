# William Crownoverâ€™s Github Portfolio

## Description

This project will be the host for my portfolio of web development work available to the public. I built this website so that I can easily consolidate my work for those who may be interested in using it or considering hiring me. My portfolio should demonstrate my abilities and growth of my skills in fullstack web development.

The form of this project consists of a home page that leads to sub pages containing specific projects. Included on the home page is a nav bar leading to about me, work, contact me, and resume. The work section includes interesting photos of the projects that will intrigue viewers to explore the specific details of the project.

## Technologies & Design

- The photos used for the site were sourced from my own photography
- The images are formatted to scale to the size on the page when viewed on a 2k display
- Flexbox and Media Queries are implemented to create a responsive layout that can adjust to a mobile display
- The page was built with accessibility in mind and passes with 100% running a Lighthouse evaluation in the google dev tools
